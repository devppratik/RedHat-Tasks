## Task-2

### _Problem Statement_
```
You will be given a file with a list of IP addresses called ip_list. 
Using the file, determine which IP address is the most recurring (listed the most times)
```

### Solution 1 - Bash - cat + sort + uniq (sol1.sh)
- How to run : `sh sol1.sh`

### Solution 2 - Bash - sort(parallel) + uniq (sol2.py)
- How to run : `sh sol2.sh`

### Solution 3 - Bash - awk (sol3.py)
- How to run : `sh sol3.sh`

### Code Explaination
1. `cat ip_list.txt` -> Reads the IP Address File and pipes the output
2. `sort` -> Sorts the file contents based on the IP
3. `uniq -c` -> Finds all the unique IPs and keeps the count
4. `sort -nr` -> Sorts the list in reverse order based on the count provided by `uniq -c`
5. `sort --parallel=8 book.txt` -> Sorts the file contents parallely on n threads
### Time Complexity Analysis
1. **Solution 1 and 2** <br/>
    `sort` used in both of the solutions uses `External R-Way merge` sorting technique. <br/>
    The expected time complexity for this is : 
    **`Î©((N/M)log(N/M)/log(R))`** , where
    ```
    N -> data size
    M -> available memory
    R -> number of merges at a single time
    ```

2. **Solution 3**<br/>
It uses a hashmap and loops through the list exactly once.<br/>
Thus the expected time complexity is : `0(n)`

### Execution Time Analysis
**Steps :**  
  1. For each of the files, we take the current EPOCH time as `start` in nanoseconds
  2. The logic of the solution is executed.
  3. After execution, we take the EPOCH time as `end` in nanoseconds
  4. The difference i.e `end - start` is the execution time of the program.  
  5. We measure the performance on a very large file having large number of IPs - book.txt

**Results**
  1. solution 1 has the highest execution time for the large file
  2. Solution 2 comes around 0.4s faster than Solution 1
  3. Solution 3 is fastest at around 5x faster than Solution 1
